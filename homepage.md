CodeRaising Boston is a 4-weekend hackathon bringing 8 teams of mentors and
apprentices together to build cool nonprofit open-source software applications.
Teams will meet at a venue to code each Saturday during the CodeRaising, with
food and drinks provided. At the end of the CodeRaising, all 8 teams are
expected to launch their applications to great fanfare.

Why CodeRaising? Because one-weekend hackathons are often too short to produce
applications substantial enough to have an afterlife.  The short deadlines also
create too much stress to let any serious mentoring happen.  We want to redress
both of these shortcomings with CodeRaising.

The goals of CodeRaising are 

1. To give participants a fun, challenging software-building experience
2. To help beginners learn by building real-world, hands-on projects
3. To build neat and useful software

## The teams

Eight teams of 5 members will be selected. Each team must consist of 2 mentors
and 3 apprentices. Apprentices are beginners who may have some basic coding
knowledge but don't yet have experience building a real application from
scratch. 

## The projects

Teams can build their application with any language and framework they want.
Projects must be useful to end users who are not coders, and they must be hosted
on GitHub, not-for-profit, and open-source.

## The application process

Mentors who want to propose projects and lead teams should write up a project
proposal and send us a link by DATE. The proposal may be hosted on Google Docs
or on GitHub as a Markdown file or gist.  The proposal should describe the
project to they propose to build during the 4-week CodeRaising, the languages and 
frameworks it will use, and some of the skills that beginners on the project
can expect to learn.

CodeRaising organizers will then review the applications and select 8 for
the CodeRaising on DATE.

The 8 teams then will have 1 week to design a logo and recruit the necessary 
team members.  

Then the CodeRaising begins, meeting on Saturday, DATE, at LOCATION from TIME
to TIME.

## The CodeRaising period

During the 4-week CodeRaising, teams are expected to meet at the VENUE on each
Saturday. They are permitted to work on the project outside that time as well.

It's expected that some people may have to skip a Saturday CodeRaising session
due to other plans and commitments. That is okay, as long as some team members
show up at the venue.

Since part of the point of the CodeRaising is to mentor beginners, teams
are expected to allow beginners to make significant contributions.

To serve this end, each team will host their codebase publicly on GitHub.  Each
project will be monitored and scored based partly on how much of the work is
contributed by the beginners.

## Launch day

At the end of the CodeRaising, teams official launch their projects. We will make 
sure to get some local tech new coverages for the projects post-launch. 

Please edit this below; just a new idea -> 

Out of all the code-raising projects, we will also select a winner and a runner up. 

The winner will get 1 year of Heroku 2-dyno hosting. ??

The runner-up will get 6 months of Heroku 2-dyno hosting. ??
