CodeRaising Boston is a hackathon bringing 8 teams of mentors and apprentices
to build cool nonprofit open-source software applications over 4 weekends.

The goals of CodeRaising are 

1. To give participants a fun, challenging software-building experience
2. To help beginners learn by building real-world, hands-on projects
3. To build neat and useful software

## The teams

Eight teams of 5 members will be selected. Each team must consist of 2 mentors
and 3 apprentices. Apprentices are beginners who may have some basic coding
knowledge but don't yet have experience building a real application from
scratch. 

## The projects

Teams can build their application with any language and framework they want.
Projects must be useful to endusers who are not coders, and they must be hosted
on GitHub, not-for-profit, open-source.
