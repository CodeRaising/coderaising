CodeRaising Boston is a hackathon bringing 8 teams of mentors and apprentices
to build cool nonprofit open-source software applications over 4 weekends.
Teams will meet at a venue to code each Saturday during the CodeRaising, with
food and drinks provided. At the end of the CodeRaising, all 8 teams are
expected to launch their applications to great fanfare.

Why CodeRaising? Because one-weekend hackathons are often too short to produce
applications that last and that people continue to maintain and improve
afterward.  And the short deadlines create too much stress to let any serious
mentoring happen. We want to redress both of these shortcomings with
CodeRaising.

The goals of CodeRaising are 

1. To give participants a fun, challenging software-building experience
2. To help beginners learn by building real-world, hands-on projects
3. To build neat and useful software

## The teams

Eight teams of 5 members will be selected. Each team must consist of 2 mentors
and 3 apprentices. Apprentices are beginners who may have some basic coding
knowledge but don't yet have experience building a real application from
scratch. 

## The projects

Teams can build their application with any language and framework they want.
Projects must be useful to end users who are not coders, and they must be hosted
on GitHub, not-for-profit, and open-source.
